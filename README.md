# Time Series Analysis Project

This project demonstrates basic time series analysis techniques using Python, focusing on understanding data trends and forecasting. The analysis is designed for educational purposes with optimized settings to save computational resources and time.

## Overview

The project covers several time series analysis techniques, including data preprocessing, visualization, and forecasting models. It provides a step-by-step guide to explore the fundamentals of time series data and develop forecasting models.

## Key Techniques

- **Data Preprocessing**: Cleaning and preparing data for analysis.
- **Visualization**: Plotting time series data to identify trends, seasonality, and anomalies.
- **Forecasting Models**:
- **Simple and Exponential Moving Averages (SMA, EMA)**
- **ARIMA (AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average)**
- **Seasonal Decomposition of Time Series (STL Decomposition)**

## Important Notes

- **Adjustable Parameters**: Parameters such as seasonal periods, window sizes for moving averages, and ARIMA model orders (`p`, `d`, `q`) are set to low values to optimize for quick analysis. These can be adjusted for more accurate and detailed results in practical applications.
- **Educational Focus**: The project is configured to run efficiently in a learning environment. Adjust parameters as needed to explore different scenarios and outcomes.
