# Time Series Analysis Project

This project demonstrates basic time series analysis techniques on S&P500 using Python, focusing on understanding data trends and forecasting. The analysis is designed for educational purposes with optimized settings to save computational resources and time.

## Overview

The project covers several time series analysis techniques, including data preprocessing, visualization, and forecasting models. It provides a step-by-step guide to explore the fundamentals of time series data and develop forecasting models.

## Key Techniques

- **Data Preprocessing**: Cleaning and preparing data for analysis.
- **Visualization**: Plotting time series data to identify trends, seasonality, and anomalies.
- **Forecasting Models**:
- **Simple and Exponential Moving Averages (SMA, EMA)**
- **ARIMA (AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average)**
- **Seasonal Decomposition of Time Series (STL Decomposition)**

## Important Notes

- **Adjustable Parameters**: Parameters such as seasonal periods, window sizes for moving averages, and ARIMA model orders (`p`, `d`, `q`) are set to low values to optimize for quick analysis. These can be adjusted for more accurate and detailed results in practical applications.
- **Educational Focus**: The project is configured to run efficiently in a learning environment. Adjust parameters as needed to explore different scenarios and outcomes.
